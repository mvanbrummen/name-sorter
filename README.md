# Name Sorter
## Requirements:

Write a console app that:

● Takes as a parameter a string that represents a text file containing a list of names.

● Orders the names by last name followed by first name.

● Creates a new text file called input file <<name-sorted>>.txt with the list of sorted

For example, if the input file contains:

```
BAKER, THEODORE
SMITH, ANDREW
KENT, MADISON
SMITH, FREDRICK
```
Then the output file would be:

```
BAKER, THEODORE
KENT, MADISON
SMITH, ANDREW
SMITH, FREDRICK
```
Example of console execution:

sort-names c:\names.txt
```
BAKER, THEODORE
KENT, MADISON
SMITH, ANDREW
```
